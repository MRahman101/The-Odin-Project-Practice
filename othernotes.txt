Inspect element tool: You can use the "Inspect" element tool to inspect the HTML and CSS makeup of a website. 
And in that mode, you can choose the option to "select an element to inspect" to click and find out things about a element. 
Any style that is struck through is overwritten. 
You can select and edit the elements of the page through the Devtools for testing purposes without altering the original. 

The Box Model: 
This is used to understand that every element has a certain amount of space (in the form of a box) that is used to manipulate the orientation and position of an alement in a webpage. 
[The part of showing the box method is in another repl: Odin Project (random test) ]
